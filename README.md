Some configuration files that I use

## Installation

### kak configuration files

Assuming you have kak installed at /some/path/bin/kak, move the kak
subdirectory from this repository to /some/path/share/kak.

### fish configuration files

Move the contents of the fish subdirectory from this repository under
~/.config/fish.
