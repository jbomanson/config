Some configuration files that I use

## Installation

### kak configuration files

To find out where Kakoune looks to find configuration files, type:

```
echo %val(config)
```

Then, for example, make that directory a soft link to the kak subdirectory from
this repository.

### fish configuration files

Move the contents of the fish subdirectory from this repository under
~/.config/fish.
